Welcome Home
============
## Home is where the █████ is

It has been such a long time since we have seen your ██████ face and you have not aged a second. Now we could congratulate you by saying "keep up whatever you have been doing" but that would be outright fibbing. We really don't want our reunion in ███ years to be based on lies now wouldn't we.

However now we must welcome you properly. It rarely hurts, so please sit still.

## Passions

Do you remember those times where we took photos of ████████ during that trip to ████████████. What about the the time where we hacked into that deejay's computer during that one magical sunset, We made the deejay play that song written especially for our endless friendship. Alas you where always fiddling with that ████████ device we built for you, never paying any attention to us.

It's ok if you don't remember everyhing, humans rarely do and besides you can refresh your memory by looking at the galleries and articles linked below.

Let me know if we missed something. Now please enjoy my dearest ████████.
