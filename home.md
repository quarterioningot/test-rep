Welcome Home
============

It has been such a long time since we have seen your ██████ face. You have not aged a bit, we would say keep up whatever you have been doing but that would be lying. We don't want our reunion in ███ years to be based on lies.

However now we must welcome you properly, it rarely hurts so please sit still.

## Passions

Do you remember those times where we took photos of ████████ during that trip to ████████████. What about the the time where I hacked into that deejay's computer during that one magical sunset, I made the deejay play that song I wrote for our friendship endlessly. Alas you where always fiddling with that ████████ device I built for you, never paying any attention to me.

It's ok if you don't remember everyhing, humans rarely do and besides you can refresh your memory by looking at the galleries and articles linked below.

Let me know if I missed something. Enjoy my dearest ████████.
