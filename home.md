Welcome Home
============

It has been such a long time since I have seen your ██████ face. You have no changed a bit, keep up whatever you have been doing.
However now I must welcome you properly, it rarely hurts.

## Passions

Do you remember those times where we took photos of ████████ during that trip to ████████████. What about the the time where I hacked into that deejay's computer during that one magical sunset, I made the deejay play that song I wrote for our friendship endlessly. Alas you where always fiddling with that ████████ device I built for you, never paying any attention to me.


It is ok if you don't remember everyhing, humans rarely do and besides you can refresh your memory by looking at the galleries and articles linked below. Let me know if I missed something. Enjoy my dearest ████████.
