Welcome Home
============
## Home is where the <random-text char-count="5">00000</random-text> is

It has been such a long time since we have seen your <random-text char-count="6">000000</random-text> face, and you have not aged a second. Now we could congratulate you by saying "keep up whatever you have been doing" but that would be outright fibbing. We really don't want our reunion in <random-text char-count="3">000</random-text> years to be based on lies now wouldn't we.

However now we must welcome you properly. It rarely hurts, so please sit still.

## Passions

Do you remember those times when we took photos of <random-text char-count="8">00000000</random-text> during that trip to <random-text char-count="12">000000000000</random-text>. What about the the time where we hacked into that deejay's computer during that one magical sunset, We made the deejay play that song written especially for our endless friendship. Alas you where always fiddling with that <random-text char-count="8">00000000</random-text> device we built for you, never paying any attention to us. However, it's ok if you don't remember everything, humans rarely do and besides you can refresh your memory by looking at the galleries and articles linked below.

Let me know if we missed something. Now go and enjoy. my dearest <random-text char-count="8">00000000</random-text>.
